//! Layer III **PCM → MP3 frame stream encoder** — Phase 2 step 10.
//!
//! This module wires the already-shipped Phase 2 primitives (polyphase
//! analysis filterbank [`crate::analysis`], forward MDCT
//! [`crate::mdct`], inverse alias reduction, the
//! [`crate::quantize`] primitive, the §C.1.5.4.4 Huffman bit chooser +
//! [`crate::huffman::emit_huffman`], the main-data assembler
//! [`crate::main_data::assemble_main_data`] and the §2.4.2.7
//! cross-frame bit-reservoir scheduler [`crate::main_data::schedule_reservoir`])
//! into a top-level [`Mp3Encoder`] that converts a stream of
//! mono MPEG-1 `i16` PCM samples into a sequence of complete
//! self-delimiting MP3 frames written to a [`std::io::Write`] sink.
//!
//! # Scope of this round
//!
//! * **Mono, MPEG-1 only** — `ChannelMode::SingleChannel`, sample rates
//!   `44.1 / 48 / 32 kHz`. LSF / stereo / VBR deferred.
//! * **CBR** — caller picks a Layer III bitrate from the §2.4.2.3
//!   ladder; the encoder selects the per-frame padding slot greedily.
//! * **Long blocks** — `window_switching_flag = false`,
//!   `block_type = Long`. No psychoacoustic block-type switching.
//! * **Zero scalefactors** — `scalefac_compress = 0`, every
//!   `scalefac_l[sfb] = 0`, no preflag, scalefac_scale = 0.
//! * **Fixed-gain heuristic** — `global_gain` is chosen per granule to
//!   keep `max|is| ≤ 8191` (the §2.4.1.7 big-values bound) via
//!   [`crate::inner_loop::search_magnitude_clamp`] *without* further
//!   psy / outer-loop noise-shaping iteration.
//! * **Single-region big-values** — `region0_count = 20`,
//!   `region1_count = 0` (covers all 21 long bands → one big-values
//!   region; region 1 and 2 collapsed). The big-values codebook is
//!   chosen with [`crate::huffman::choose_best_table_for_region`].
//!
//! # End-to-end self-decode validation
//!
//! The integration test under `tests/stream_encoder_roundtrip.rs`
//! encodes one second of a 440 Hz sine tone at 44.1 kHz / 128 kbit/s,
//! feeds the emitted byte stream back into the crate's own
//! [`crate::Mp3Demuxer`] + the decode chain
//! (`decode_huffman` → `requantize` → `imdct_granule` → `synth_granule`)
//! and asserts (a) every frame's header + side-info + main_data
//! round-trip exactly, (b) the recovered PCM has finite PSNR > 20 dB
//! against the input.
//!
//! # What this module deliberately does **not** do
//!
//! No psychoacoustic model, no outer noise-shaping loop, no LSF, no
//! ID3v2 frontmatter, no short-block / mixed-block window switching.
//! **Joint-stereo MS** encode is opt-in
//! as of round 146 ([`Mp3Encoder::new_joint_stereo_ms`]): the encoder
//! computes the §2.4.3.4.9.2 forward MS matrix `M = (L+R)/√2`,
//! `S = (L-R)/√2` on each granule-pair's full post-MDCT spectrum and
//! emits header `mode = '01'` with `mode_extension = '10'` (ms_stereo
//! on, intensity_stereo off). **Intensity-stereo** encode
//! (§2.4.3.4.9.3) is opt-in as of round 284
//! ([`Mp3Encoder::new_joint_stereo_is`] /
//! [`Mp3Encoder::new_joint_stereo_ms_is`] /
//! [`Mp3Encoder::new_joint_stereo_auto_is`]): long scalefactor bands at
//! or above a caller-chosen start band are coupled to a single
//! magnitude in the left channel plus a per-band stereo position
//! carried as the right channel's scalefactor, and the header
//! `mode_extension` low bit is set (`'01'` intensity only, `'11'` MS
//! below the bound + intensity above it).
//!
//! Xing / Info VBR-info frame emission is **opt-in** as of round 142:
//! call [`Mp3Encoder::enable_xing_info`] before [`Mp3Encoder::finish`]
//! to prepend one carrier frame with the magic + per-stream totals to
//! the on-wire output. See [`crate::xing_info`] for layout details.
